STALK

An innovative app that allows users to keep track of current stocks.

User Story:
As someone with an interest in the economic state we find ourselves, I want an app that will allow me to research companies of my interest
in an effective way. I would like to have access to the companies stock history, current value, and most recent news articles that will affect the company itself.
